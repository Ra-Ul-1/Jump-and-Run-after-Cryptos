# Jump-and-Run-after-Cryptos

This is the first project of the Ironhack Web Dev bootcamp (Berlin May 2021).

This game is about the new economy of cryptocurrencies: it illustrates the increasing divide between the establishment, aka the boomers, and the younger generation - the Degens.

The game is about a guy with a moustache - Frank - who tries to collect cryptocurrencies on a beach while an Italo Disco remix of a Dua Lipa song playing in the background

The goal is to collect as many tokens (Ethereum, BTC, and Dogecoin) as possible.

The boomers (personified by Jamie Dimon here) want to fight this guy because they see him as a threat to the establishment. If Frank touches one of the boomers, he'll die.

All in all, I believe this is a timely topic as it illustrates some of the deep changes our society is experiencing - i.e. the decentralisation of money, characterised by a gradual loss of power of the establishment
